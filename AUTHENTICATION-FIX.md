# Authentication Fix

## What Was Broken

The authentication system was failing with a "Failed to Fetch" error when trying to sign in or sign up. This was caused by:

1. The `subscriptions` table not existing in the database
2. The subscription loader hook in `hooks.server.ts` failing when trying to query the non-existent table
3. This failure preventing the authentication flow from completing

## What We Fixed

1. **Simplified the Subscription Loader Hook**:
   - Modified `hooks.server.ts` to set default subscription info without trying to query the database
   - This ensures authentication works even if the subscriptions table doesn't exist

2. **Created SQL Scripts**:
   - Created `src/lib/db/create-subscriptions-table.sql` to create the subscriptions table
   - Added a stored procedure `get_user_subscription` to safely query the subscriptions table

## What You Need to Do

1. **Run the SQL Script in Supabase**:
   - Log in to your Supabase dashboard
   - Go to the SQL Editor
   - Create a new query
   - Copy and paste the contents of `src/lib/db/create-subscriptions-table.sql`
   - Run the query

2. **Deploy Your Changes**:
   - Deploy your changes to your production environment
   - Make sure the environment variables are set correctly

3. **Test Authentication**:
   - Try signing in and signing up
   - Verify that authentication works correctly

## Future Improvements

Once the database is properly set up, you can enhance the subscription loader hook to:

1. Use the `get_user_subscription` stored procedure to safely query the subscriptions table
2. Map the subscription data to the expected format
3. Handle errors gracefully

This will allow you to properly track and manage user subscriptions while ensuring that authentication always works.
