# Authentication Fix (Updated)

## What Was Broken

The authentication system was failing with a "Failed to Fetch" error when trying to sign in or sign up. This was caused by:

1. The `subscriptions` table not existing in the database
2. The subscription loader hook in `hooks.server.ts` failing when trying to query the non-existent table
3. Error handling issues in the authentication flow
4. Lack of proper error logging to diagnose issues

## What We Fixed

1. **Simplified the Subscription Loader Hook**:
   - Modified `hooks.server.ts` to set default subscription info without trying to query the database
   - This ensures authentication works even if the subscriptions table doesn't exist

2. **Enhanced the Subscription Utility**:
   - Updated `src/lib/subscription.ts` to handle database errors gracefully
   - Added nested try-catch blocks to handle different types of errors
   - Provided default subscription info in case of any errors

3. **Improved the Auth Callback Handler**:
   - Enhanced `src/routes/(marketing)/auth/callback/+server.js` with better error handling
   - Added detailed logging to help diagnose issues
   - Redirects to login page with error parameters instead of throwing exceptions

4. **Updated the Sign-In Page**:
   - Modified `src/routes/(marketing)/login/sign_in/+page.svelte` to display error messages
   - Added logging of authentication state changes
   - Improved the user experience when errors occur

5. **Created SQL Scripts**:
   - Created `src/lib/db/create-subscriptions-table.sql` to create the subscriptions table
   - Added a stored procedure `get_user_subscription` to safely query the subscriptions table

## What You Need to Do

1. **Run the SQL Script in Supabase**:
   - Log in to your Supabase dashboard
   - Go to the SQL Editor
   - Create a new query
   - Copy and paste the contents of `src/lib/db/create-subscriptions-table.sql`
   - Run the query

2. **Deploy Your Changes**:
   - Deploy your changes to your production environment
   - Make sure the environment variables are set correctly

3. **Test Authentication**:
   - Try signing in and signing up
   - Check the browser console for any error messages
   - Verify that authentication works correctly

## Debugging Tips

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check the Browser Console**:
   - Open the browser developer tools (F12)
   - Look for any error messages in the console
   - Check the network tab for failed requests

2. **Check the Server Logs**:
   - Look for error messages in the server logs
   - The enhanced logging we added will help diagnose issues

3. **Verify Database Setup**:
   - Make sure the SQL script ran successfully
   - Check that the subscriptions table exists in your Supabase database

4. **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**:
   - Sometimes authentication issues can be caused by stale cookies
   - Try clearing your browser cache and cookies
